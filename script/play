# `play` is our main Play CLI. Think of this as the overseer: it knows about
# all of the services in Play and can control them via a number of helper
# scripts.
#
# Helper scripts are located in this directory — script/ — and are loaded by
# the subcommand you run:
#
#   play update
#   # => Same as running `script/update`
#
# You should really only be interfacing with the processes and backend of Play
# through this script. If you're manually dropping down into using commands
# directly, You're Doing It Wrong™ (and should probably let us know so we can
# write something to help you out!)
