# Test Sounds

These test sounds are all grabbed from
<http://www.dr-lex.be/software/testsounds.html>. This means we can test Play in
isolation from any existing libraries you have on your own disk, and we can
stub out certain functionality in test without having to worry about blowing
your environment out. It also gives us a sane test case setup for each machine
that we can trust to be there.
