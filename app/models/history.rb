module Play
  # Keeps track of the historical record of Play. Think plays and user votes and
  # playcounts, oh my.
  #
  # redis:
  #
  #   Histories are stored in a couple of different spots. Typically we just
  #   access everything through the song_ids List, which gives us a quick last x
  #   played. All comprehensive histories can be pulled from some more detailed
  #   keys.
  #
  #   There's a concept of a unique ID involved here, which is a simple
  #   concatination of song ID and datetime the play was requested. This allows
  #   a general way of uniquely identifying a given play. That's then used as a
  #   key for other redis keys.
  #
  #   The keys are stored in redis as follows:
  #
  #     play:histories:song_ids          - A List of all song IDs played.
  #     play:histories:ids               - A List of all mappable IDs.
  #     play:histories:ids:#{uniq}:id    - The ID of the song played.
  #     play:histories:ids:#{uniq}:user  - The login of the user who played it.
  #
  #     play:histories:songs:#{id}:count - The playcount of the song.
  #
  #     play:histories:#{login}:song_ids - List of song IDs played by the user.
  #     play:histories:#{login}:ids      - A List of all user-mappable IDs.
  #     play:histories:#{login}:ids:#{uniq}:id - Song ID
