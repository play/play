# play [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/play/play.png?branch=v3)](https://travis-ci.org/play/play)

## Install

There are a lot of moving parts in Play. We've built a bootstrap script to help
cut down the amount of things you'll have to do to get Play up and running. The
instructions below are platform-specific and assume an install on top of a brand
new, fresh-out-of-the-box machine.

###

For **OS X**, you'll need to first install Apple's [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools)
so you can get software compiled on your Mac.

Once that's done, **install Homebrew**:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

With Homebrew installed, install Git:

    brew install git

Then clone the project:

    git clone https://github.com/play/play && cd play

And now you can start the bootstrap process:

    script/bootstrap


### the dirty harry developer's guide to a still beta v3 of play

Until we're further along, here's what you need to know:

    script/bootstrap
    script/play

`script/play` will run two servers: `web` and `music`. `script/bootstrap` should
let you know if there was a problem setting things up, but if you run into
trouble, look at the contents of `/tmp/play-bootstrap`.

You can shut everything down with:

    script/play stop

If you run into weird shit or anything confusing at all, file an issue. We're
getting close to wanting to polish this off, so every little bit helps.

## Development

Hacking on this? Spin it up manually with:

    RAILS_ENV=development script/play start

That'll make sure you don't have to reload your server each time, and it'll
also show you logs in your console.

Don't want to type `RAILS_ENV` every time? Add a line to `config/play.yml`:

    env: development
